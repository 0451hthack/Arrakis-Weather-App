## Purpose Of Application
Weather Of Arrakis serves as my first Front-End App I made with React. It consumes data from  OpenWeatherMap's
API; to receive and display back the current weather forecast of the desert filming
locations used in both Dune: Part One and Two respectively.<br><br> Each of the desert locations has its own weather 
component widget, that displays when clicked by the user. Mobile Users must click on the same button again, to close out 
the component. This provides room to view another location.<br/><br/>This isn't necessary on desktops and such, 
since there is more width to work with. The second section of the App features a search component that enables
searching for any city you can think of. OpenWeatherMap's API will fetch the current forecast data for the city you 
have searched for.<br><br> This enables a change of scenery; letting yourself envision another 
city as a stand-in for a location in the Dune Universe, if you so wish. You can choose Cairo to represent Arakeen
for example. The page must be refreshed if you wish to search for another location.

If any reception errors occur, then you must change the codebase and provide your own API key/link for the forecast components to work properly.
